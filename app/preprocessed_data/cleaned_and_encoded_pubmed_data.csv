fluorescent complementary rna crna using random primer the labeled crnas were hybridized onto the arraystar human circrna array the raw data were extracted and the acquired array image were subjected to quantile normalization followed by heat map and volcano plot analysis the expression of circrnas with large fold change wa verified by realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction rtqpcr finally gene ontology go and kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genome kegg enrichment analysis were performed in the differentially expressed circrnas and circrnamicrorna mirna network wa constructed result the total rna extracted from skbr and mcfa had high integrity and quality the expression profile of circrna in skbr and mcfa cell were significantly different shown by fluorescent expression signal compared with mcfa cell there were upregulated circrnas and downregulated circrnas in skbr cell there were circrnas with logfc of which were upregulated and were downregulated moreover circrnas with logfc among them were upregulated in skbr cell including hsacircrna logfc hsacircrna logfc hsacircrna logfc hsacircrna logfc and hsacircrna logfc a well a were downregulated including hsacircrna logfc hsacircrna logfc and hsacircrna logfc the expression level of hsacircrna hsacircrna and hsacircrna were further validated by rtqpcr in consistent with the result of microarray go analysis showed that differentially expressed circrnas were significantly enriched in the biological process of heart development p cellular component in the cell adhesionrelated component p molecular function in protein serinethreonine kinase activity p kegg analysis revealed that differentially expressed circrnas were significantly enriched in the pikakt signaling pathway conclusion the expression profile of circrna in her positive breast cancer cell is significantly different from that in normal mammary epithelial cell the differentially expressed circrnas may be served a potential diagnostic or therapeutic target for her positive breast cancer

disorder are all characterized by reduced plasma adiponectin and insulin resistance in peripheral tissue quantitatively skeletal muscle is the major site of insulin resistance both low plasma adiponectin and insulin resistance contribute to an increased risk of type diabetes and cardiovascular disease in several study we have investigated insulin action on glucose and lipid metabolism and at the molecular level insulin signaling to glucose transport and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle from healthy individual and in obesity pcos and type diabetes moreover we have described a novel syndrome characterized by postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and insulin resistance this syndrome is caused by a mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor gene insr we have studied individual with this mutation a a model of inherited insulin resistance type diabetes obesity and pcos are characterized by pronounced defect in the insulinstimulated glucose uptake in particular glycogen synthesis and to a lesser extent glucose oxidation and the ability of insulin to suppress lipid oxidation in inherited insulin resistance however only insulin action on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis is impaired this suggests that the defect in glucose and lipid oxidation in the common metabolic disorder are secondary to other factor in young woman with pcos the
